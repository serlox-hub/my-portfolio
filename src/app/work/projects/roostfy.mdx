## Overview

Roostfy was my final project for an Android development course, later evolving into the leading app in the freestyle rap battle niche. It combined technical innovation with cultural relevance, becoming a creative platform for thousands of users. Its intuitive interface and engaging content led to organic growth and strong user retention.

## Key Features

- **Extensive Beat Library**: A large and growing collection of original beats to freestyle over.
- **Creative Battle Modes**: Multiple battle styles designed to stimulate creativity and improve flow.
- **Recording Functionality**: Users could record and share their performances directly from the app.

## Development and Growth

- **Monetization**: Introduced in-app ads and a subscription model to generate revenue.
- **UX & Performance Enhancements**: Continuously improved the user experience and app performance based on user feedback.
- **Community Management**: Oversaw user engagement, content moderation, and feature requests.

## Outcome

By 2019, after reaching peak visibility in its niche, I sold Roostfy following strategic differences with co-founders. It remained one of the most recognized apps in the freestyle rap scene.
