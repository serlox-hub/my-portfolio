## Overview

**Shopo** is a minimalist native Android app I developed to solve a personal frustration: existing shopping list apps were either bloated or overcomplicated. Shopo was designed from the ground up to prioritize **speed, simplicity, and user experience**.

## Key Features

- **Fast Item Entry**: Add items to your list in seconds with an intuitive UI.
- **No Unnecessary Features**: Built to be lightweight and distraction-free.
- **Persistent Lists**: Save and reuse your grocery lists with zero hassle.
- **Offline-First**: Fully functional without an internet connection.

## Design Philosophy

Shopo is intentionally simple. It avoids overengineering, bloated design patterns, or excessive options. The app is meant to be opened, used, and closed in seconds â€” just what you need when you're at the store or planning quickly.

## Outcome

Shopo was published on the **Google Play Store** and gained a small but consistent user base. However, due to inactivity and lack of updates over time, my developer account was eventually closed and the app was removed.
