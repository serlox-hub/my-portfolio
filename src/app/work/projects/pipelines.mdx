## GitLab CI Pipeline Templates

This internal project provides **extendable and reusable GitLab CI/CD pipeline templates** for all Gradle and NPM projects within the company. Designed to reduce duplication and manual setup, these templates allow entire teams to enable complete build and deployment pipelines with just a few lines of configuration.

### Key Features

- **Automatic Versioning**: Semantic versioning based on Conventional Commits.
- **Changelog Generation**: Produces conflict-free changelogs, even with multiple open merge requests.
- **Tagging & Releases**: Automates Git tags and GitLab Releases with every versioned deployment.
- **Helm Integration**: Generates and deploys Helm charts directly to staging environments.
- **Vulnerability Reporting**: Detects resolved vulnerabilities and includes them in the changelog.
- **Complete Lifecycle Pipelines**:
  - Build, test, and publish jobs
  - Preview environment testing and deployment
  - Multi-environment deployment support

### Developer Usage

Projects only needed a minimal configuration to activate full pipeline capabilities:

```yaml
include:
  - project: "engineering/core-services/backstage/ci-cd/templates-gitlab-cicd"
    ref: "5.+"
    file: "pipelines/pipeline-complete.yml"
