## Life

**Life** is a lightweight React-based project I created to explore sprite rendering and dynamic component updates within the React framework. It simulates a small animated field where characters (sprites) are rendered and updated in real time.

## Key Features

- **Sprite Rendering**: Renders multiple characters on a virtual field using simple image-based sprites.
- **React State Management**: Characters are positioned and updated via Reactâ€™s state and props, allowing easy experimentation with animations and rendering cycles.
- **Modular Design**: Built with reusable components to keep the structure scalable for more complex scenes.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project was to practice working with:
- Conditional rendering
- Dynamic layouts
- Visual feedback loops in React

## Tech Stack

- **React**: For building interactive UI and rendering logic.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Logic and animations.
